      <h5 class="hero-quote">“Pedro is the ideal marketing bundle for a team like ours, that can’t simply afford to hire a full and experienced marketing department. For the price of one, you get a great copywriter, a developer and also someone that is constantly thinking about conversions and how to grow your business.”</h5> - <h5 class="hero-quoteowner">STAT Martial Arts</h5>

      <h3>I’m the right guy to < 1% of startups.</h3>
      <p>If you’ve raised a bit of money, are self-funded or have some early revenue.</p>
      <p>If you have a small but mighty product team, maybe a sales guy...</p>
      <p>But can’t afford to invest in a full-time in-house marketing yet (and you know how much you would)...</p>
      <p>We can definitely be a great team.</p>
      <h4><b>BUT:</b></h4>
      <p>If you believe marketing is just a way to do some cool things and not the 24/7/365 optimised sales force that it is...</p>
      <p>Sorry to tell you but we <b>won’t</b> make a great team.</p>
      <h3>Sweet... now that everyone else has left - let’s start talking about how I can help you grow your business.</h3>
